# the "Winter Project"
a godot game that grew a bit too big (and too complex) for one man to handle  <br><br>
Shelved for later. 
# reason for failure
- lack of documentation
- Too complex and daunting
- unfun doo doo water game loop
- "I want to make a game with so many features it hides the horrible 1 dimensional game loop"
